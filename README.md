## Installation Instructions

Please run `poetry install` inside the folder, then nagivate inside the frontend folder and run `npm install` to download dependencies.

## Unsolved Problems

One part of creating this which really threw me was the forms input. I had attempted to use the format

```
setFormData({ ...formData, name: plant.name });
```

to auto-set the form data, meaning that a user would not have to fill out every field to update a plant. However, this did not seem to work.
